# Larpit.fi

[Larpit.fi](https://larpit.fi) is a crowd-sourced archive of past and future larps organized in Finland, by Finns, or having a significant Finnvasion.

## Technologies used

* PostgreSQL
* Node.js
* TypeScript
* Next.js
* React
* Prisma.io

## Getting started

Have PostgreSQL, Node.js (22+) and VS Code.

Install deps:

```
npm install
```

Create an `.env` file not unlike the following:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=postgres://japsu@localhost/larpit?schema=larpit
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3158
AUTH_SECRET=eeeee
SMTP_HOSTNAME=smtp.ethereal.email
SMTP_USERNAME=youraccount@ethereal.email
SMTP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

See `src/config.ts` for available environment variables.

Note that `?schema=larpit` is mandatory (Prisma hardcodes it in migrations). Otherwise you may pick the database name, username etc. freely.

If you want to see how the HTML email messages look like, get a throwaway SMTP account at [ethereal.email](https://ethereal.email). If you leave `SMTP_HOSTNAME` unset, email text content is logged at the terminal.

You may want to create the database beforehand with the `createdb` command to get strings to sort properly according to Finnish sort order (ÅÄÖ at the end of the alphabet and not with AAO):

```bash
createdb --locale-provider icu --locale fi_FI.UTF-8 --icu-locale fi_FI --template template0
```
or via `psql`
```sql
create database larpit
locale_provider icu
icu_locale 'fi-FI'
locale 'fi_FI.UTF-8'
template template0
```

Start the development environment with

```
npm run dev
```

You can add some larps to the database with

```
npm run db:seed
```

Now open <http://localhost:3158> in your browser. Log in with your [dev.kompassi.eu](https://dev.kompassi.eu) account.
